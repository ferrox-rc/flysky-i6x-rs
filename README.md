# flysky-i6x-rs

A minimalist, clean-slate RC transmitter firmware for the **FlySky FS-i6X**, written in `no_std` Rust.

Focused on the built-in **A7105** 2.4 GHz RF transceiver (**AFHDS2A** protocol), **i-BUS** telemetry, and the **128×64 LCD** interface.

---

## 1. Overview & Philosophy

The FS-i6X open-source journey was pioneered by the remarkable work of the [OpenI6X](https://github.com/OpenI6X/opentx) project, which successfully brought OpenTX/EdgeTX to this hardware and reverse-engineered the radio architecture.

`flysky-i6x-rs` explores a complementary design philosophy: an experimental, clean-slate firmware written in bare-metal `no_std` Rust designed with:
- **Zero-Heap, Deterministic Memory:** Fully static allocation with bare-metal `no_std`, eliminating dynamic allocation overhead, allocator stalls, and heap fragmentation.
- **Lock-Free Concurrency & Watchdog Recovery:** Deterministic priority-driven interrupt scheduling (`TIM16` 260 Hz packet sync, `EXTI2` RF ready) paired with lock-free atomic double-buffering. 2.0s independent hardware watchdog (`pac::IWDG`) with LSI clock isolation, debug halt freezing, bounded sync, and <2 ms in-flight warm reset recovery that bypasses startup interlocks to prevent lockouts.
- **Strict Scope:** Dedicated support for the built-in hardware (A7105 AFHDS2A + i-BUS), 4-axis gimbals, switches, trims, 20-model storage, 14-channel matrix mixer, and a 128×64 monochrome UI.
- **Lightweight Footprint:** **~110.5 KB Flash ROM** (leaving ~9.5 KB / ~7.9% headroom out of the 120 KB partition) and **~8.9 KB static RAM** + 1 KB LCD framebuffer + 1 KB USB PMA (leaving >7.0 KB stack safety margin). See [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#4-memory-footprint) for the complete memory budget.

## 4. AFHDS2A & i-BUS Subsystem Design

### Frequency Hopping (FHSS)
AFHDS2A distributes transmission across 16 pseudo-random frequencies generated from the transmitter's unique silicon ID:
```
UID (at 0x1FFFF7AC) -> LCG Random Seed -> 16 Unique Channels (1..164 with min spacing >= 5)
```

### Packet Protocol
1. **Bind Packets (`0xBB` / `0xBC`):** Broadcasts TX ID and hopping table to allow receivers (e.g. FS-iA6B) to sync.
2. **Stick Data Packet (`0x58`):** 38-byte frame containing up to 14 channels encoded as microsecond pulses (1000–2000 µs).
3. **Settings Packet (`0xAA`):** Directs receiver output mode (PWM, PPM, i-BUS, or S.BUS).
4. **Telemetry Reception Window:** The transmitter switches the A7105 to RX immediately following packet transmission to receive i-BUS sensor telemetry frames (TX/RX voltage, RSSI, temperature, RPM, etc.).

---

## 5. Display & User Interface (128×64)

The ST7567 parallel LCD driver maintains a **1024-byte framebuffer** in SRAM (`128 * 64 / 8`). Updating the entire screen takes < 1.2 ms via direct 8-bit GPIO port writes (`GPIOE->ODR`).
- **Throttled Refresh Rate (30 Hz)**: Throttled via the hardware SysTick timer (`time::millis()`) to a steady 30 Hz (~33 ms). This completely decouples graphical drawing from the multi-kHz flight control loop, eliminating servo latency and stutter.
- **Electronic Volume (EV) Contrast Adjustment**: Digitally adjustable LCD contrast (`15..=55`, default 37 / `0x25`) in `Radio Setup` with instant live hardware preview and Flash persistence.
- **Ferrox-RC Startup Splash Screen**: 28x27 kinetic delta emblem, firmware name, and build version displayed for 1200 ms with concurrent, cadence-independent 4-note ascending welcome fanfare ($C_6 \to E_6 \to G_6 \to C_7$, 660 ms).
- **Multi-Page Flight Dashboard**: 5 switchable screens cycled by tapping `[BIND]` or pressing `[UP]` / `[DOWN]`:
  1. **Page 1/5 (Gimbals & Trims)**: Live stick sliders with Mode 2 right-aligned throttle, center markers, trim ticks, physical switch arrow glyphs (`^`/`-`/`v`), and dual split horizontal bar for VRa / VRb with center ticks.
  2. **Page 2/5 (Primary Channels 1..10)**: Real-time graphic bars and exact microsecond pulse readouts (988..2012 µs) across primary flight channels.
  3. **Page 3/5 (Auxiliary Channels 11..18)**: Real-time graphic bars and microsecond pulse readouts across auxiliary expansion channels.
  4. **Page 4/5 (Model Dashboard)**: Full 10-character model name with 12x12 model type glyph (Airplane, Glider, Heli, Quad, General/Boats), bound receiver ID, throttle curve configuration, and live flight timers.
  5. **Page 5/5 (Telemetry Sensors)**: Dedicated diagnostics showing real-time RSSI, link state, packet odometer counters (`TX`/`RX`), battery voltages (`RX`/`TX`), and session extremes (`mRSS`/`mRX`).
- **Dynamic Horizontal Battery Gauge**: High-contrast battery icon in the status bar with live 3-stage charge bars (empties left-to-right from tip as voltage drops, and fills right-to-left from base).
- **3-Slot Icon Menu & Proportional Scrollbar**: 12x12 MDI glyphs, high-contrast selection highlights, proportional right-edge scrollbar, and return position preservation across all submenus.

## 8. Flashing, Full Flash Backup, & Reversion

The stock FlySky FS-i6X features a built-in Micro-USB port wired directly to the microcontroller. Flashing or backing up requires no ST-Link probe or permanent hardware modifications:

### Step 1: Enter Factory ROM DFU Mode

The method to enter DFU bootloader mode depends on whether you are currently on stock FlySky factory firmware or already running custom firmware:

#### A. First-Time Flashing from Stock Factory Firmware (R53 Bootloader Access)
Because the original stock FlySky factory firmware does not include a software key check to trigger the DFU bootloader, entering DFU mode for the first time requires hardware access to the `BOOT0` line via the **`R53`** solder pads:
1. Ensure the transmitter is switched **OFF** and remove the rear case screws.
2. Carefully separate the rear case. Be aware of the battery wires connected between the two halves. Once separated, locate the two unpopulated solder pads labeled **`R53`** on the back of the motherboard (near the microcontroller). It is best to connect the USB cable to the rear case now.
3. Momentarily bridge/short the two `R53` pads using tweezers, a jumper wire, or a screwdriver tip.
4. While holding the bridge across `R53`, have the USB cable connected to your PC and switch the transmitter power switch **ON**.
5. Bridging `R53` pulls the MCU's `BOOT0` pin to 3.3V, causing the chip to boot directly into its factory ROM DFU bootloader (`0483:df11` for STM32, `314b:0106` for APM32). The transmitter screen remains blank, and the PC detects the device as `STM32 BOOTLOADER`.
6. Once powered on, you can remove the bridge across `R53`. You do not need to keep it bridged while flashing.

> [!TIP]
> For board photos, pad locations, and Windows driver setup (Zadig / STM32CubeProgrammer), refer to the comprehensive [OpenI6X Flashing & Upgrading Guide](https://github.com/OpenI6X/opentx/wiki/Flashing-&-Upgrading).

#### B. Upgrading from Custom Firmware (OpenI6X or flysky-i6x-rs)
Once custom firmware is installed, **no disassembly or opening the case is ever needed again**:
1. Ensure the transmitter is switched **OFF**.
2. Push both horizontal trim buttons inward towards the power switch (**Roll Left** + **Yaw Right**) and switch the radio **ON**.
3. The firmware immediately triggers the software DFU bootloader jump and enumerates over USB.

### Step 2: Backup Entire Flash Memory (CRITICAL BEFORE FIRST FLASH)
Before flashing any custom firmware, pilots should pull their complete 128 KB on-chip Flash memory (including stock firmware, factory calibration, and existing model data) directly to a file for 100% safe, instant reversion:
```bash
# Pull complete 128 KB on-chip Flash to a local backup file:
dfu-util -a 0 -s 0x08000000:131072 -U stock_backup.bin
```

### Step 3: Flash flysky-i6x-rs
Flash the compiled release binary via USB DFU:
```bash
# For STM32F072:
dfu-util -a 0 -s 0x08000000:leave -D flysky-i6x.bin

# For APM32F072:
dfu-util -a 0 -d 314b:0106 -s 0x08000000:leave -D flysky-i6x.bin
```

> [!TIP]
> **DFU Error State (`DFU state(10) = dfuERROR`)?**
> If `dfu-util` reports `Device's firmware is corrupt. It cannot return to run-time operations`, this is **not** a firmware bug or hardware fault. It is generated by the chip's factory ROM bootloader when a prior transfer ended without `:leave` or was interrupted.
> - **Clear the error**: Run `dfu-util -a 0 -e` to send a `DFU_CLRSTATUS` reset.
> - **Prevention**: Always include `:leave` on `-s 0x08000000:leave` so the bootloader exits cleanly.
> - **Consequence of ignoring**: Subsequent flash or read attempts will halt until the status is cleared.

### Step 4: Revert to OpenTX / Stock Anytime
Because the hardware DFU bootloader is stored in permanent, read-only system ROM by STMicroelectronics, the transmitter is **unbrickable**. You can restore your full flash backup at any time:
```bash
dfu-util -a 0 -s 0x08000000:leave -D stock_backup.bin
```

## 9. Development Methodology, Automated Testing, & AI Assistance

This project was built through a **human-directed, AI-assisted development workflow** ("vibe-coding" with rigorous physical hardware bench testing and automated test harnesses). Having previously contributed to OpenI6X, domain knowledge of the FS-i6X hardware, pinouts, and protocol timings was used to direct LLM pair-programming tools to rapidly implement the `no_std` Rust architecture.

### Automated Testing & Dual-Target Harness
To guarantee mathematical correctness and protocol compliance without requiring a physical radio or slow hardware emulators, `flysky-i6x-rs` features a **zero-file-move dual-target test harness**:
- **Host Unit Test Execution**: Running `cargo test-host` compiles the codebase against the host target (`x86_64`) with standard library support, executing 36 unit and adversarial regression tests across flight curves, digital trims, matrix mixers, and CRSF/ELRS state machines in **sub-millisecond time**.
- **Peripheral & Timing Decoupling**: Peripheral drivers (`uart.rs`, `time.rs`) use `#[cfg(test)]` mocks to simulate serial UART FIFO queues and advance virtual time deterministically.
- **Physical Hardware Validation**: Every subsystem (DMA ADC scanning, A7105 SPI/RF state machine, ST7567 parallel bus LCD, USB HID/CDC descriptors, USART2 CRSF/ELRS engine, and Flash storage) has been deployed and verified on real FlySky FS-i6X hardware.

For detailed test architecture, adversarial verification scenarios, and developer commands, refer to the **[Testing Methodology & Verification Guide](docs/TESTING.md)**.

We welcome community code review, contributions, and PRs to continue refining and hardening the codebase!
